# Contributing during the Hackathon

Guidelines for fast, safe collaboration during the event.

Branching

- Use short-lived feature branches: `feature/<short-description>`
- Open pull requests against `main` and request a quick review from one teammate.

Commits

- Keep commits small and focused. Use present-tense messages and reference issue numbers.

Code style

- Keep formatting consistent. If using JS/TS, prefer Prettier defaults.

Communication

- Use a shared channel (Slack/Discord) for quick syncs and blockers.
- Add a short PR description including how to run and test the change.

Emergency rollback

- If a critical issue is introduced in `main`, revert the PR or open a hotfix branch and prioritize a patch.


During the hackathon, prioritize delivering the demo over perfect architecture—keep things simple and well-documented.
